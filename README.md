# gmx_wheel_plus
gmx_wheel+ is a tool for analysing and visualizing the orientation of helical antimicobial peptides based on molecular dynamics simulations trajectories generated using the Gromacs simulation suite.

**Purpose of the tool:**

The general purpose of the tool is to generate more accurate helical wheel "like" projections of antimicobial peptide based on more advanced _in silico_ data rather than just the primary sequence.

The ampliphilic structure of the helical region of anitmicrobial peptides is key to their activity, which has led helical wheel projection to be one of the most simple but effective tools for researches to use in their design process.
The simple and clear projection of the structure of the peptide allows one to easily analyse the residue composition and select resiudes for modification when designing new analogs.

With the lowering of the barrior of entry to more advanced techniques such as molecular dynamic simulations, much more advanced _in silico_ data can be generated for an antimicrobial peptide before syntheis and _in vitro_ evaluation.
